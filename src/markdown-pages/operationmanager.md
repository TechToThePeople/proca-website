# Operations Manager
## Who we are
Fix the status quo builds a free software campaigning tool with a strong focus 
on privacy and coalition building. We work only for progressive not for profit 
organisations and political parties to power their campaigns.
We started working on the software about 1 year ago, and have now a tool 
that has been used by 25 organisations, 40 campaigns and with more than 
150’000 actions taken we are growing fast, with at least 3 campaigns that aim 
at 1 million signatures (ECIs).
Next year, we want to increase the number of NGOs that use our tool and start
a community, where progressive campaigners can learn more about each other
campaigns and tactics and, we hope, collaborate and win together.
Where are we
We have been focused on finding users and developing the software and all 
related tools.
We have done some admin (created the company, invoicing,...), but are behind 
and would need help to build a solid foundation and running it smoothly.
And let’s be frank: neither Marcin nor Xavier are the most organised 
persons and we will/have already dropped the ball.

## Position’s goal
Make sure we are a tight running ship, that we got the contract signed, that 
invoices are sent in time, that we have a good time tracking.
As a start up, we are looking for unicorns that are both able to be the Chief 
Operating Officer, the admin assistant, the lawyer and willing to talk with 
clients and prospects too. As almost sane persons, we know that unicorns 
don’t exist - another victim of the climate crisis - and we list all these points 
and skills, knowing that nor you - nor anyone- will have them all.
And we know that someone that is good at putting in place processes and build
structures isn’t necessarily the one that is the best for long term day to day 
follow them, but we don’t have -yet- the capacity to get two people working on
that.

**Employment type**: Preferably business-to-business; we are incorporated in 
Estonia so an employment contract might not make sense or be easy to 
arrange.

**Hours**: we envision this position will need around 5-10 hours a week. We’d like 
to settle based on hours worked.

## Skills
- Being organised 
- Being able to organise others 
- Good with dealing with unclarity 
- Upfront in communication 
- Detail oriented but knowing when to cut corners - yes, we need to cut 
corners, what’s hard is to know which ones 
- Spoken and written english (level B2 minimum) 
- Good at discovering and learning how apps work (eg. Trello, Banking 
system, Invoice app, etc) 
- Legal oriented mind, being able to read/tune contracts, knowledge of 
GDPR a plus 
- Help on Fundraising / Promotion. 
As we are a small team, if you think one of the skills/interest you have could 
benefit Fix the Status Quo, we would love to hear about it and see if we can 
find a way to apply them

## Tasks
- You keep an eye on processes and tasks happening in the company, and 
the team following them and completing priorities first 
- You manage communication and interactions with clients and partners in 
a timely manner: arranging meetings, sending and receiving documents 
(agreements, invoices) 
- You watch the money flows (incoming and outcoming invocies are paid) 
and intervene 
- You make sure we have all the necessary paperwork, curate legal 
documents, publish ones that need to be published, communicated with 
the lawyer when we need their assistance. 
- You are able to use spreadsheet software to work with data and reports 
when this is needed. Eg. export bank balance for an year and calculate 
category costs; filter a CSV with EU MEP data to find records interesting 
to us. 
- Optional: Engaging with our community - Support/QA. We are lucky to 
have a lot of different organisations using proca for their campaign and 
we find it inspiring to discuss about their campaign and help them when 
we can. If you are interested to know more about the campaigns and 
help them be sure everything is as best as it can be on their sites, we 
would see that as part of the job. If you’re not particularly interested, it’s
fine too  :) 

## What we offer
- Flexible working time. We would need you to react rather quickly (within 
a day or two), but for the ongoing work, as long as it’s done regularly, 
you are free to work whenever works for you. 
- Flexible location. as long as you have some overlap with European 
timezones, doesn’t matter where you are, or how often you change 
location 
- Working with a huge range of organisations, small and big, in a lot of 
countries and working on a lot of different topics. 
- Learn more about online campaigning. We are or have been working with
some of the biggest online campaigns and are happy to share whatever 
we learnt. 
- Support your activism. If you need to take time off to go to 
demonstrations or organise an action, we are flexible. If your 
organisation wants to organise an online campaign, I’m pretty sure we’d 
be happy to provide our tools (for free)
