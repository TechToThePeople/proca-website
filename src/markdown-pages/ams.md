# Action Management System

Once a campaigner has decided that an online action (a petition, asking to mail an elected representative...) of the most common question is: **which tool to use**?

I'll start by assuming you are a progressive organisation that want a more inclusive and open world to everyone regardless of ethnicity, gender identity and expression, socio-economic status, nationality or sexual identity, because that's the organisations we want to help.

I'll assume as well you are clear_(ish)_ on the strategy, how to frame your ask, you know your supporters, members and partners are going to be behind this action, you have an idea how to achieve the political goal of the campaign and how it's going to change the system.

## Questions to ask yourself

As technologists that have been working for some of the biggest progressive online campaigns in our countries, we'd like to share a few questions we have back and hopefully help you choose the right tool  _and sneakily explain why we build proca and why we think it's the one_

And we learnt the hard way that what makes the success of a campaign is 90% invisible, the boring things that support the action behind the scenes. The features that you didn't think about that will make your campaign go viral and all the architecture so our server doesn't crash when it happens. The things that needs to be there before you launch, even if your supporters don't seem them.

I'd like to start with some broader questions to understand the context and then dig into the features. Hopefully, it will help you think of the 90% invisible before it's too late and help you plan a better campaign.

## As an alliance or with partners?

Most successful campaigns have multiple partners involved, civil society organisations with local actors, trade unions or with grassroot organisations.

But it's more complicated to agree on a political ask, and it often brings more discussions linked to the tools too:
- do we "duplicate" the campaign on each partner's website, do we have a dedicated one just for the campaign?
- who has access to the emails of the signatories and can contact them? One lead organisation? each manage their own?
- who decides/pay? how many organisations are going to have to approve things like the layout or how a feature works?

These coalitions can take multiple shapes from very structured and centralised with a strong lead to an organically grown informal network. No matter how well planned, these shapes will change for any campaign running long enough. Ideally, you want a tool that is able to adapt to these changes.

I know, you want we talk about that cool way the supporters can take action, the signature form... We'll talk about it soon, but first: 


### Existing site or new website (new layout)?

If you plan to run your campaign on your website, you bring familiary and credit through your branding _-that can help convince to take action-_ and you answered a lot of questions about the design, layout and content management system: whatever you have! 

Having a dedicated website makes sense too, you can be hyper-focussed on the campaign, try bold designs and messaging that can go viral _-that can help convince to take action too-_ and it doesn't have to be expensive, you can find plenty of free or cheap great wordpress themes for instance.

In general, we advice to go with the CMS (wordpress, netlify, drupal, ghost...) you know already, because you'll have enough rush and last minute changes on the content without having to learn a new editor.

You should plan/ask your design agency for two things after the campaign is over:
- have a static html export of the site (that can't easily be modified). Otherwise it will be yet another unmaintained website that will be hacked.
- buy the domain name for several years and get a hosting for this static export (some options like github are free)

You have no idea how often you and your organisation we'll want to refer to that campaign and share its url. And that helps the visibility of your organisation in the search engines too (SEO)

--> action widget, so easy to embed on either the campaign site or on the partners

I know, you want we talk about that cool way the supporters can take action, the signature form... We'll talk about it soon ;) 

### What to do with the emails of the signatories?

I have yet to work on an online action that will solves everything. If you loose or win that campaign, they will be others to fight, and having a motivated list of supporters that you can contact by mail will certainly help. If you want to succeed, you need remember to place your action in a longer term plan, even if you are going to be only focussed 100% on your online action now.

And during the campaign, keeping your supporters informed, ask them to boost by sharing on social media, to join for an offline action or to support financially can often make a big difference on your impact.



You need to see how the emails _(of the supporters that gave their consent to be contacted #GDPR)_ are going to end up in the mailing list/CRM tool you use. The more automated and real time the better, because the last thing you will want to do when you have an urgent email to blast is to deal with csv files to import and export.


### Clear view of your progress/dashboard
The total number of signatures might be the goal, but being able to navigate which mailing from which partner or what social media action brought these signatures is crucial for success.
