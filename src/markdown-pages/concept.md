# Why does the world needs Proca?

Status quo isn't working for the vast majority of people and it's not working for the planet either. We need to fix the status quo.

They are a lot of civil societies organisations that have (part of) the solutions, but none of them can achieve the political pressure to implement them without working together nor without engaging with members of the public to create creating a massive civil resistance.

Proca is the tool we built to help civil society to organise and empower the people to achieve radical change.

Civil society organizations (CSOs) have the strategic and political experience to work in coalition to reach their goal.


On the other hand, there are implicit restraints to cooperation. We built Proca to reduce and eliminate them:

## Can I have a bigger logo?
Most organisations want to promote their brand and know their members will engage more if they are asked to take actions on a site they know, with a familiar logo and layout that know and like. Each partner of a campaign can embed the action widget on their website. Campaigners don't have to be concerned about sending their members to a separate websites, Techies don't have to adapt another campaign tool to add their layout, Supporters don't have to trust yet another website.

But as a coalition, all signatures are counted together, no matter through which partner they came through. No need to manually add numbers, no more errors and delays, every website has the same counter that includes all signatures, in real time.

## Who's got the emails list?
Most organisations are reluctant to share the contact members with other organisations. They have spent years building a relationship with them, they might depend on their donations for their existence. They care about their privacy.

Proca allows each organisation to collect signatures, ask for their consent to be contacted and push them into their CRM.

So next time there is an urgent email to send to their supporters, the campaigners can spend their time writing the perfect email instead of running after exel files and struggling with imports.

## Why should I trust you with my supporters' personal data?

You shouldn't. And you don't have to: every data we collect can be encrypted with a key that only you have. So all the personal data we collect on your behalf is safe, as we can't read it once we stored it.

## I absolutely need that! [insert very specific feature]

Most campaigns fall intro broad categories (a petition, a mail to target, an action on social media, registering to an event...) and a lot of campaign tools cover most combinations of the common requested features.

But sometimes, there is that unique feature, that extra 10% of magic that makes or break a campaign and that isn't provided out of the box.

Because we provide a customisable widget, the techies of the organisations can 9 time out of 10 implement it from within their website, while keeping the 90% covered by the "out of the box" proca.

And because we are opensource, they can always implement the extra 1% and modify everything needed. An because we are free software, we will be able to add that new tactic into the core, so if another organisation needs it, that will be there out of the box

## Will you be able to handle our massively successful campaign?

Proca's creators have written and hosted supported a lot of campaigns for a lot of very big organisations. People took more than 30 million actions.

We learnt the hard way how to support massive online actions, we licked our scars, learnt our lessons and build Proca so it scales

Elixir for the backend and everything frontend is static react js, if you want the details.

## Damn, I forgot to mention [insert campaign best practice]

Over the years, we have ab tested and learnt what works and what doesn't. Social media integration? Responsive website? Multi-lingual? Automatic detection of the country?

Chances are that if it's a good idea, it's part of Proca already, and ready to use in your campaign, even if you didn't ask for it.

And if it's not, chances are that we, or someone else in the community will be able to add it to, so we all get better and you can run more successful campaigns.

Because the status quo isn't working, but together, we can fix it.
