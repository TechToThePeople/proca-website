Like petition but
- can sign as an organisation or individual
- can have moderation/approval workflow for one or the other
- need a display of the result (and offer the option to filter by country?) and/or as a choropleth?

How it's done "usually"

During the preparation phase, shared google sheet for signatories, google form for the most advanced

Once launched: open letter + list of signatories, usually as bullet points with their names

No option or clear workflow to sign post launch for more VIPs or new NGOs

No option for "normal" people to sign
