Application for the EU datathaton.

This focus on the EP, but the process and need is similar for any other parliament



Democracy must be a two-way conversation. PROCA connects citizens and Members of the European Parliament in a new kind of dialogue built for the post-pandemic era.

Description of the app (maximum 250 words)

MEPs vote almost daily, either in committees or in plenary, but citizens seldom have an opportunity to let them know their position and encourage them to support their views.

Civil Society Organisations, trade unions, grassroot movements or political parties have a unique position to navigate the complex EU decision process and engage citizen at the right moment.

PROCA provides them an easy to use campaign tool to inform citizens before a vote to empower their supporters and members to take action on.

The tool citizen to find their MEPs based on their location, show what they intent to vote (for, against or undecided) and contact them through email, phone or social media. MEPs will be able to update their voting position through a secured system.

Existing online tools often allow to “spam” MEPs with a pre-written email, an MEP might get annoyed with hundreds of similar messages. Instead of filling the MEPs’ mailboxes, proca offers a clear visual representation of where the supporters are in a map tailored to their constituency, to help MEPs understand what their constituents care about. 

Proca closes the feedback loop after the vote and allow to build a genuine dialog to strengthen democracy. It offers each MEP to send a message to all the supporters that took action and share the result and help them understand better the work done in the European Parliament and its impact on everyone’s life.
