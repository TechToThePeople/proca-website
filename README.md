# Website for the site

If you are looking for the code of the application, check out [the frontend](https://github.com/TechToThePeople/proca) or [the backend](https://github.com/TechToThePeople/proca-backend])

Are you still here? want to help fixing a typo or improve the pitch? 

**Awesome**

It's a gatsby website, to run it:

- yarn (to install all the dependencies)
- yarn develop (to run a dev website)
- yarn build (to generate all static files)

Most of the content is under src/pages

Otherwise, the usual, fork, git commit, git push, pull request and voila
